What is-it ?

COUIJS is a minimalist tool which is written in Javascript, read an XML configuration file, and create dynamically a user-interface which allow to edit the configuration file.

The typical use of COUIJS is an embedded device, where the configuration is stored as an XML file. Yoy could change the configuration by one of these methods:
- use vi or something similar (nano, etc.)
- create a custom UI in javascript
- or use COUIJS.

The concept behind COUIJS is to add a few information within the XML config file so the tool can create the UI. These information will be typically:
- the type of input (checkbox, list, etc.)
- some information related to the type of input (for instance, if it is a list, that would be the list of possible of values)
- and some optional rules (for instance you might want to edit some settings only if another setting has a specific value).

The COUIJS also needs the XML configuration file to be organized following a specific hierarchical structure.

Also, COUIJS is using the DOJO toolkit. This way, it can uses the nice widgets provided by Dojo (dijit).

Example:

This very example demonstrate the use of the tool. We'll use a dvr-like device, where we have to configure some settings such as Audio, Video, Networking and so forth.

Syntax description:

The XML config file needs to be organized using a three levels hierarchie:
- section
- subsection
- key

Help:

This is an optional tag, and it can be used for both a Section, Subsection, or a Key.
The text described in the help tag is displayed as a tooltip when the mouse cursor moves over the displayed field.

Example:

            <KEY name="VideoH264Profile"
                label="H.264 Profile"
                help="H.264 Profile : BP=Baseline - MP=Main - HP=High"
                type="list"
                value="High"
                index="2"
                values="['Baseline', 'Main', 'High']">
            </KEY>

Advanced:

This is an optional tag, and it can be used for both a Section, Subsection, or a Key.
When a Section, Subsection or Key is marked with 'advanced="true"', the item will be displayed only when the 'Advanced Options' button is checked.

Example:

            <KEY name="VideoH264Profile"
                label="H.264 Profile"
                help="H.264 Profile : BP=Baseline - MP=Main - HP=High"
                type="list"
                value="High"
                index="2"
                values="['Baseline', 'Main', 'High']"
                advanced="true">
            </KEY>


Why this stupid name...

COUIJS would stand for for 'COnfiguration User Interface JavaScript'
