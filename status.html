		<h1>Current Status</h1>
		COUIJS is currently in Alpha stage. <br>
		This said, it is fully functional and usable. <br>
		Just a few useful features are still missing... <br>
		<br>

		<h1>To Dos</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Allow 'enable' and 'visible' rules into a Section</li>
			<li>the 'Name' tag should not be mandatory (that would allow to specify a name only if a rule references the Section, Subsection or Key).</li>
		</ul>
